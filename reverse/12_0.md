with some gdb and ghidra we find some static variables we input them and we get 
tthe flag but the new thing is how the varible is used like a pointer to memeory

[+] Welcome to /challenge/babyrev_level12.0!
[+] This challenge is an custom emulator. It emulates a completely custom
[+] architecture that we call "Yan85"! You'll have to understand the
[+] emulator to understand the architecture, and you'll have to understand
[+] the architecture to understand the code being emulated, and you will
[+] have to understand that code to get the flag. Good luck!
[+]
[+] This is an introductory Yan85 level, where we trigger Yan85 architecture
[+] operations directly. The parts of Yan85 that are used here is the emulated
[+] registers, memory, and system calls.
[+]
[+] This is a *teaching* challenge, which means that it will output
[+] a trace of the Yan85 code as it processes it. The output is here
[+] for you to understand what the challenge is doing, and you should use
[+] it as a guide to help with your reversing of the code.
[+]
CORRECT! Your flag: pwn.college{4k_FPEQ7-dZXyqJje_EKondYuhc.dFTNzMDL1kjMzQzW}
